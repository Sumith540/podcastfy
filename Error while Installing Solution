The error you're seeing indicates that the system is unable to find a C compiler, which is necessary to install the package. 

Hereâ€™s how to resolve this issue:

1. Install Required Build Tools: Make sure you have essential build tools installed, which include compilers like gcc and make.

Run the following command:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential

2.Install Python Development Headers: Some Python packages require the Python headers. You can install them with:

sudo apt install python3-dev

3. Try Installing the Package Again: After installing the necessary compilers and headers, try running:

pip install podcastfy
